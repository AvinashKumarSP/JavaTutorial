Introduction and Background
I joined the team earlier this year, initially recruited as a Junior VP. However, I was fortunate to receive a promotion to Senior VP before formally joining this team. My initial mandate, alongside the team, was to focus on ingesting external data sources into the CDP data lake. At that time, we had a fairly senior-heavy team with two Senior VPs, one Junior VP, and a Senior Associate.

Team Realignment and New Responsibilities
After successfully delivering on the Crescendo initiative, it was decided that having two Senior VPs overseeing external data loads was excessive. Marut, one of the Senior VPs, transitioned to BPE under Jayati’s leadership, which allowed for a clearer structure within the team.

Subsequently, Jayati entrusted me with leading the WorldCheck initiative. I’m pleased to say that we delivered it successfully, positioning our team as a reliable partner in handling critical external data projects.

Challenges with QTX Training and Delivery Adjustments
While our team was concentrating on external data ingestion, teams in the US, London, and Singapore were closely collaborating with the QTX team to set up the environment and execute their first production release. However, only those team members were given access to the necessary QTX training, while our team had to wait. Initially, we were told that a comprehensive 3-week classroom training would be provided in Glasgow, but after a delay of two months, we were informed that the training would not take place due to insufficient headcount. Eventually, we were given credits to complete the training independently, similar to our counterparts in the other regions.

Despite this, our team remained focused on delivering WorldCheck. Initially, we committed to a delivery date of October 15, balancing both the WorldCheck implementation and our QTX training. However, due to a push from the business side, we accelerated our efforts and brought the delivery forward to September 18, temporarily pausing our training to meet the revised deadline.

Current State and Future Aspirations
At present, our team is primarily working on tasks assigned to us, which contribute to the overall QTX deliverables. While we are proud of our contributions, we are eager for the opportunity to take on more ownership of projects from the ground up. This would allow us to leverage our platform engineering, machine learning, data, and cloud skills more effectively to address larger business challenges within the C-Tech space.

Looking Ahead
We believe that our team’s diverse skill set positions us well to drive impactful business solutions. We’re keen to take on more end-to-end projects, where we can apply our technical capabilities in a more strategic and problem-solving capacity. We look forward to exploring opportunities where we can make an even greater contribution to the business.
